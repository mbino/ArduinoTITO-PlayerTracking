# Arduino TITO and Player Tracking
A homebrew slot machine TITO, player tracking and display project
By Marc Davis (2/16/2021)

  Project goals: To allow home slot machine owners the ability to use the player tracking
  display and card reader (with RFID modifications) which are normally non-functional
  outside of casinos. This replaces the Bally MasterCom device. The project can now
  communicate directly with SAS-enabled machines for remote control, TITO and metering.
